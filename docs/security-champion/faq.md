# Frequently Asked Questions ‚ùì

### Do I have to be a security expert to be a Security Champion?
**Absolutely not!** This is a initiative for people to learn more about security and generate a network for people to share experiences and competence.

### Who can become a Security Champion?
Everyone who considers themselves part of a development team can become a Security Champion. If you are a developer, ux-designer, tester, citizen developer or anything in-between, you are welcome to join. There is no requirement to be an Equinor employee to join, we invite consultants as well!

### I want to attend the Kick off event in october. Do you provide a WBS for hours and travel expenses?
The Security Champion initiative is a network we invite IT professionals to join and share experiences. Members need to ask their project managers or line leaders for approval to travel and spend time on the network.

### Can we have more Security Champions in our team?
We recommend each team to have 1-2 champions, and share their learnings with the rest of the team. Remember that it is the entire team that is responsible for the security of applications in the team's portfolio. The Security champions will support the team, but not bear any extended responsibility.
