### Welcome Champions

To initiate the security champions network, we invite you to the kickoff!

The Security Champions network is a crucial part to create a strong security culture at Equinor. So get ready to join a bunch of security minded people in a journey to develop a unique perspective, engage in some cool security activities, learn niche new things and have a great time together.
