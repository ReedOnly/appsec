# Security Champion

## Info about Security Champion

Ideally, each development team should have one or more team-members who takes on the role of Security Champion. When an **area** are supported by many small teams (1-2 persons) this **area** should be represented by one or more security champions.

A Security Champion is a team-member who amplifies the security message at the team level.

In practice, this means to act as the "security conscience" of the team.
You do not need to be a security expert to become a Security Champion, an interest for security is more than enough.
